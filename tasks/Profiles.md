# Task
## User Profile Page

We will have a controller, service and profile Partial html page for the front End. Backend will have a controller for Profile page requests. 

When a user goes to their profile page, right now, they will see information about that user such as their email, their Username, their followedsites and Id.

Eventually, we will turn the profile page into a page that has updates/tips on their followed sites.

For now (April 12th), lets stick to having just their user information.
